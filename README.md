# gb-wordyl

_Wordyl_ is a _Wordle_ clone for Game Boy and Mega Duck by bbbbbr and stacksmashing. You can find the original repository [here](https://github.com/bbbbbr/gb-wordle). This fork expands the wordbanks for both English and Brazilian Portuguese, making the game more complete.

## Changes in English

The 46 words (and counting) added include a few words that were present in Josh Wardle’s original wordbank that were deemed cringe by bbbbbr (which, to their credit, they are – though other very similar cringe words were left in for some reason). The other ones are words that are in the current The New York Times bank – whose vastness is too powerful for _Wordyl_’s compression and the Game Boy’s technical limitations – and words in common use that still haven’t made their way there for being too recent, and often too marginalised additions to the English language (most of which may or may not be considered cringe for different reasons).

The password “obese” was also restored to the list of answers for completeness’ sake, so that it is the same as that on Josh Wardle’s _Wordle_.

## Changes in Portuguese

Words with diacritics were introduced, using Fernando Serboncini’s [_Termo_](https://term.ooo/) as a main source for the update. The answer list was also changed to match _Termo_’s, so that there are answers with diacritics as well. Additionally, one popular word that hasn’t made its way into dictionaries yet has been added. The prebuilt version available at the releases page changes the title screen to _Termyl_, to reflect its identity as a _Termo_ version of _Wordyl_.
